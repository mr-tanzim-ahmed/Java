✅ To-Do List Project
A simple console-based Java To-Do List application that allows users to manage tasks using basic commands: add, remove, list, and stop. This project demonstrates the separation of user interface and program logic based on the concepts taught in the Java Programming MOOC (Part 6, Section 2)(https://java-programming.mooc.fi/part-6/2-separating-user-interface-from-program-logic)
